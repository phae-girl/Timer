Timer
=====

Just a simple little timer app to remind me to check the stove while I'm coding.

##Release Notes
###V0.5
2013-06-15

Did a little bit of code tidy-up and added some UI improvements. Control buttons (Pause, Resume, Cancel) now toggle on and off in response to timer state. For example, the Resume button is disabled when the timer is running. Also added a checkbox to allow timers to repeat.
